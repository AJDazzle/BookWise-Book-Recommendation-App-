# BookWise-Book-Recommendation-App
## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a hybrid recommendation model that integrates BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with collaborative filtering to enhance book recommendations within a mobile application. By leveraging a Firebase database for efficient data storage and retrieval, the system aims to provide personalized book suggestions tailored to individual user preferences and reading habits.

## Methodology

### BERT Model

The BERT model excels in understanding the contextual relationships within book descriptions, genres, and user reviews, allowing it to extract meaningful semantic features that enrich the recommendation process. BERT is trained on a curated dataset of book-related content to generate embeddings that capture the nuances of the textual data.

### Collaborative Filtering

In parallel, collaborative filtering analyzes user interactions, such as ratings and reading history, to identify patterns and similarities among users, further refining the recommendation accuracy. User interaction data is collected and used to train the collaborative filtering model, developing comprehensive user profiles.

### Hybrid Recommendation Engine

The hybrid recommendation engine synthesizes insights from both BERT and collaborative filtering methodologies to generate real-time, personalized book recommendations. The engine combines the semantic understanding from BERT with the user preference patterns identified by collaborative filtering, providing a holistic approach to book recommendations.

## Implementation

The implementation involves:

1. Collecting user interaction data
2. Training the BERT model on the book dataset
3. Applying collaborative filtering techniques to develop user profiles
4. Integrating the hybrid recommendation engine into a user-friendly mobile application interface

## Expected Outcomes

The project aims to significantly improve recommendation relevance and accuracy, leading to enhanced user engagement and satisfaction. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with a robust backend infrastructure, this project represents a significant advancement in the realm of intelligent recommendation systems for books, ultimately enriching the reading experience and fostering a deeper connection between users and literature.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of books stored in a CSV file. Each entry in the dataset includes attributes such as book ID, title, authors, average rating, ISBN, language code, number of pages, ratings count, text reviews count, publication date, and publisher. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of books, including popular series and works by renowned authors.
